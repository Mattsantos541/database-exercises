### Temp Tables
Using the example from the lesson, re-create the employees_with_departments table.

Add a column named full_name to this table. It should be a VARCHAR whose length is the sum of the lengths of the first name and last name columns
Update the table so that full name column contains the correct data
Remove the first_name and last_name columns from the table.
What is another way you could have ended up with this same table?


CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE employees_with_departments 
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name, dept_no, dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN dept_emp USING(emp_no)
JOIN departments USING(dept_no)
LIMIT 100;

alter table full_name varchar(256)

alter table drop first_name, last_name;
